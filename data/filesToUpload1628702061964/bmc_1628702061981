I could've been killed!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today.

Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya?

'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Damn! I'm late for school!I finally invent something that works!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting.

Dork thinks he's gonna drown.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Marty, will we ever see you again?Whoa. This is heavy.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Stella!

Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.He's a Peeping Tom!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Crazy drunk driver.No!

I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.He's a Peeping Tom!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.He's an absolute dream!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Weight has nothing to do with it.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.He's a Peeping Tom!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Great Scott!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!He's an absolute dream!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Weight has nothing to do with it.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.He's a Peeping Tom!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Whoa. This is heavy.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.You really think I ought to swear?Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Great Scott!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Weight has nothing to do with it.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Damn! I'm late for school!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Marty, will we ever see you again?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Crazy drunk driver.What are you looking at, butthead?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Whoa. This is heavy.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days.

There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Well, I figured, what the hell?I finally invent something that works!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah...

Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.I finally invent something that works!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.I've never seen purple underwear before!Give me a Pepsi Free.Save the clock tower!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.What are you looking at, butthead?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Great Scott!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?You really think I ought to swear?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Well, I figured, what the hell?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!So you're my Uncle Joey.

We're the Pinheads.I finally invent something that works!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Give me a Pepsi Free.Look!

What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!I finally invent something that works!I've never seen purple underwear before!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Oh. One other thing.

You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Damn! I'm late for school!He's an absolute dream!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.What are you looking at, butthead?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.

Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.I've never seen purple underwear before!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Don't worry.

Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Great Scott!Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Well, I figured, what the hell?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Great Scott!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Whoa. This is heavy.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Crazy drunk driver.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Save the clock tower!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Well, I figured, what the hell?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Save the clock tower!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Whoa. This is heavy.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Damn! I'm late for school!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Crazy drunk driver.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?He's a Peeping Tom!Well, I figured, what the hell?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.I've never seen purple underwear before!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya?

He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Course!

I didn't disintegrate anything.

Shoot it!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Course!

We're the Pinheads.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.He's a Peeping Tom!What are you looking at, butthead?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Crazy drunk driver.Damn!

Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I finally invent something that works!Great Scott!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented.

Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.I finally invent something that works!Well, I figured, what the hell?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Crazy drunk driver.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man.

According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Great Scott!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Scram, McFly.

He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.He's an absolute dream!Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Now, remember.

Hey, you on the bike!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.I finally invent something that works!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.See you in about 30 years.Well, I figured, what the hell?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!You really think I ought to swear?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Save the clock tower!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.I've never seen purple underwear before!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?You really think I ought to swear?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor.

According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Marty, will we ever see you again?Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!You really think I ought to swear?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Save the clock tower!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Maybe you were adopted.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired.

Get your damn hands off her!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch.

We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days.

Get your damn hands off her!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Stella!

They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.I'm from the future.

Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?I've never seen purple underwear before!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!I've never seen purple underwear before!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.I finally invent something that works!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.He's a Peeping Tom!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.You really think I ought to swear?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...See you in about 30 years.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor.

Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Whoa. This is heavy.He's a Peeping Tom!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?See you in about 30 years.I've never seen purple underwear before!Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.There's that word again.

Get your damn hands off her!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.

Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.

I could've been killed!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Weight has nothing to do with it.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot.

And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.I've never seen purple underwear before!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.I've never seen purple underwear before!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.It's already mutated into human form!

Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Hey, McFly!

The space-time continuum?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!No! Marty!

Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.No!

I thought I told you never to come in here.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model.

Your friend, Marty.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Whoa.

If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys.

It was terrible.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Damn! I'm late for school!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through.

According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids.

Dork thinks he's gonna drown.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Course!

Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it?

My density has brought me to you.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Crazy drunk driver.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists.

Kennedy?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Whoa. This is heavy.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Crazy drunk driver.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Weight has nothing to do with it.Hey, hey, listen, guys...

Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I finally invent something that works!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Great Scott!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Damn! I'm late for school!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Great Scott!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.He's a Peeping Tom!You really think I ought to swear?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Marty, will we ever see you again?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?I finally invent something that works!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Give me a Pepsi Free.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.See you in about 30 years.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Save the clock tower!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?I finally invent something that works!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Well, I figured, what the hell?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Well, I figured, what the hell?Marty, will we ever see you again?I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Maybe you were adopted.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?'

Everybody who's anybody drinks.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Calvin? Wh...

Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Hey, McFly!

I thought I told you never to come in here.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.You really think I ought to swear?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Whoa. This is heavy.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Weight has nothing to do with it.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Marty, don't be such a square.

Shoot it!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Great Scott!Give me a Pepsi Free.Damn! I'm late for school!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Save the clock tower!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact.

You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Look!

Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!See you in about 30 years.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.See you in about 30 years.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think!

I mean, your destiny.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Well, I figured, what the hell?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah...

I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Weight has nothing to do with it.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!We're the, uh...

Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Things have certainly changed around here.

He's never stood up to Biff in his life!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.See you in about 30 years.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model.

Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!I've never seen purple underwear before!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Radiation suit? Of course.

Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself.

I could've been killed!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance.

But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?You really think I ought to swear?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.All right.

They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?I've never seen purple underwear before!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!He's a Peeping Tom!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Whoa. This is heavy.Damn! I'm late for school!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Give me a Pepsi Free.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Marty, will we ever see you again?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.You really think I ought to swear?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Save the clock tower!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Maybe you were adopted.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids.

Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.He's an absolute dream!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Well, I figured, what the hell?Save the clock tower!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Whoa. This is heavy.Well, I figured, what the hell?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.What are you looking at, butthead?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys.

Although, if it wasn't for him...Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!What-what the hell is a gigawatt?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid.

From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!He's an absolute dream!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.See you in about 30 years.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!What are you looking at, butthead?I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.He's a Peeping Tom!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Great Scott!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?You really think I ought to swear?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.He's an absolute dream!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Save the clock tower!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.He's a Peeping Tom!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Weight has nothing to do with it.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Save the clock tower!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Save the clock tower!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Well, I figured, what the hell?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Marty, will we ever see you again?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.You really think I ought to swear?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Give me a Pepsi Free.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future?

Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.He's a Peeping Tom!Maybe you were adopted.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good?

You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.You really think I ought to swear?Whoa. This is heavy.I finally invent something that works!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Ah, Jesus Christ!

Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Oh, that's Joey.

You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Radiation suit?

From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Marty, will we ever see you again?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?He's an absolute dream!See you in about 30 years.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Great Scott!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Save the clock tower!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.He's an absolute dream!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Damn! I'm late for school!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Great Scott!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Hey, hey, listen, guys...

He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance.

I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Hey, McFly!

Help me take him in the house!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys.

Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?You really think I ought to swear?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Damn! I'm late for school!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Whoa. This is heavy.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.

Shoot it!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Weight has nothing to do with it.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?He's an absolute dream!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.What about all that talk about screwing up future events?

Everybody who's anybody drinks.He's a Peeping Tom!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?What are you looking at, butthead?Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Crazy drunk driver.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?What are you looking at, butthead?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.

You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Whoa. This is heavy.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.He's an absolute dream!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Well, I figured, what the hell?Great Scott!All right.

Time to change that oil.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!I've never seen purple underwear before!He's a Peeping Tom!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Marty, don't be such a square.

He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Marty, will we ever see you again?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.

Good night, future boy!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Don't worry.

He's never stood up to Biff in his life!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hey, you!

So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Crazy drunk driver.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future.

He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!See you in about 30 years.Whoa. This is heavy.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids.

This is heavy.Crazy drunk driver.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Biff. What a character.

The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?See you in about 30 years.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Oh, that's Joey.

Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Give me a Pepsi Free.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Marty, will we ever see you again?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Damn! I'm late for school!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Well, I figured, what the hell?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Maybe you were adopted.Crazy drunk driver.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Save the clock tower!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Damn! I'm late for school!Marty, will we ever see you again?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Marty, will we ever see you again?He's a Peeping Tom!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Marty, will we ever see you again?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Marty, will we ever see you again?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Marty, will we ever see you again?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Whoa. This is heavy.Marty, will we ever see you again?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Give me a Pepsi Free.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?I finally invent something that works!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Roads?

Do we become assholes or something?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Crazy drunk driver.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Marty, will we ever see you again?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother.

Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Damn!

Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Roads?

Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Damn! I'm late for school!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Weight has nothing to do with it.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!I finally invent something that works!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.I've never seen purple underwear before!Give me a Pepsi Free.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?I've never seen purple underwear before!Damn! I'm late for school!He's an absolute dream!I've never seen purple underwear before!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Damn! I'm late for school!Stand tall, boy.

You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?You really think I ought to swear?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?He's a Peeping Tom!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Save the clock tower!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!He's an absolute dream!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Whoa. This is heavy.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.See you in about 30 years.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Don't worry.

Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Calvin? Wh...

The space-time continuum?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...I finally invent something that works!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya?

That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.He's a Peeping Tom!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Marty, will we ever see you again?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.No!

And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah...

Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I've never seen purple underwear before!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah...

Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.What are you looking at, butthead?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Whoa. This is heavy.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hey, Dad! George!

Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Well, I figured, what the hell?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.I'm from the future.

Good night, future boy!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.I finally invent something that works!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented.

Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see.

I thought I told you never to come in here.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'?

Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him.

He's gotta look good on television.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density.

I mean, your destiny.I finally invent something that works!The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Crazy drunk driver.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Weight has nothing to do with it.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Damn! I'm late for school!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?He's a Peeping Tom!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Well, I figured, what the hell?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Maybe you were adopted.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Damn! I'm late for school!What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Whoa. This is heavy.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Whoa. This is heavy.Give me a Pepsi Free.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Marty, will we ever see you again?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Well, I figured, what the hell?I finally invent something that works!Marty, will we ever see you again?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.See you in about 30 years.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Save the clock tower!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Let's see if you bastards can do 90.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through.

My density has brought me to you.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think!

You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Course!

Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!See you in about 30 years.Crazy drunk driver.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly?

Shoot it!I finally invent something that works!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.You really think I ought to swear?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Now, remember.

All right.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Maybe you were adopted.He's an absolute dream!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Course!

I thought I told you never to come in here.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row.

Do I know your mother?Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!What-what the hell is a gigawatt?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Crazy drunk driver.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Marty, will we ever see you again?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Give me a Pepsi Free.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Don't worry.

He's gotta look good on television.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented.

Better get used to these bars, kid.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!It's already mutated into human form!

This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!He's an absolute dream!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?See you in about 30 years.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?What are you looking at, butthead?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Marty, will we ever see you again?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.He's a Peeping Tom!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.I've never seen purple underwear before!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Well, I figured, what the hell?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.I finally invent something that works!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Whoa. This is heavy.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Weight has nothing to do with it.Whoa. This is heavy.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Save the clock tower!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.He's an absolute dream!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?I've never seen purple underwear before!Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Marty, will we ever see you again?Save the clock tower!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.See you in about 30 years.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.What are you looking at, butthead?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Maybe you were adopted.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Whoa. This is heavy.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?What are you looking at, butthead?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Whoa. This is heavy.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!You really think I ought to swear?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.

Do we become assholes or something?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Look, Marvin, you gotta play.

He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.What are you looking at, butthead?What are you looking at, butthead?Weight has nothing to do with it.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Give me a Pepsi Free.See you in about 30 years.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?He's a Peeping Tom!Well, I figured, what the hell?You really think I ought to swear?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Give me a Pepsi Free.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Great Scott!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Calvin?

From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance.

Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Marty, will we ever see you again?Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler!

According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Stella!

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph.

Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?See you in about 30 years.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Damn! I'm late for school!You really think I ought to swear?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.I finally invent something that works!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Marty, will we ever see you again?Crazy drunk driver.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Give me a Pepsi Free.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.He's an absolute dream!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?What are you looking at, butthead?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Give me a Pepsi Free.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?I finally invent something that works!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.I finally invent something that works!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.He's a Peeping Tom!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.I've never seen purple underwear before!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Damn! I'm late for school!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Whoa. This is heavy.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Let me show you my plan for sending you home.

I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Well, I figured, what the hell?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Okay.

Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Great Scott!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Well, I figured, what the hell?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Whoa. This is heavy.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Damn! I'm late for school!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Well, I figured, what the hell?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Well, I figured, what the hell?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Give me a Pepsi Free.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Whoa. This is heavy.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Maybe you were adopted.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Great Scott!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.He's a Peeping Tom!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Oh, my God. They found me.

The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.I've never seen purple underwear before!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.See you in about 30 years.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Oh. One other thing.

Time to change that oil.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.

Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!He's an absolute dream!I finally invent something that works!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.See you in about 30 years.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Save the clock tower!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Damn! I'm late for school!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too.

Shoot it!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped.

So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Biff. What a character.

Where we're going, we don't need roads.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Radiation suit? Of course.

I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.What are you looking at, butthead?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Oh, my God. They found me.

On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything.

Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.So you're my Uncle Joey.

We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.He's a Peeping Tom!You're late!

Do we become assholes or something?Well, I figured, what the hell?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.I've never seen purple underwear before!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!He's an absolute dream!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me.

Bring in the next group, please.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Lorraine.

Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Marty, will we ever see you again?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Maybe you were adopted.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Great Scott!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.I finally invent something that works!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Whoa. This is heavy.Whoa. This is heavy.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Great Scott!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!He's a Peeping Tom!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad...

We're the Pinheads.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Damn! I'm late for school!Weight has nothing to do with it.Radiation suit? Of course.

Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.I've never seen purple underwear before!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

Better get used to these bars, kid.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Give me a Pepsi Free.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Who the hell is John F.

He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Crazy drunk driver.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance.

Shoot it!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.

No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!You really think I ought to swear?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model.

Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Ah, Jesus Christ!

Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.You really think I ought to swear?No! Marty!

Would ya?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Hey, hey, listen, guys...

I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Great Scott!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Great Scott!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Damn! I'm late for school!Yes. Yes. I'm George.

Nobody has two television sets.What are you looking at, butthead?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Maybe you were adopted.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Damn! I'm late for school!Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!It's already mutated into human form!

Where we're going, we don't need roads.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Crazy drunk driver.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Save the clock tower!Great Scott!He's an absolute dream!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!What are you looking at, butthead?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.He's an absolute dream!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.What are you looking at, butthead?Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.

That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Crazy drunk driver.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Maybe you were adopted.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Damn! I'm late for school!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Weight has nothing to do with it.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Whoa. This is heavy.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.I finally invent something that works!Hello?

If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Hey, McFly!

'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.He's a Peeping Tom!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.

I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening.

Everybody who's anybody drinks.Save the clock tower!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.See you in about 30 years.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?He's an absolute dream!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Well, I figured, what the hell?Marty, will we ever see you again?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Crazy drunk driver.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Maybe you were adopted.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Give me a Pepsi Free.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Crazy drunk driver.I've never seen purple underwear before!Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Crazy drunk driver.Maybe you were adopted.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.I've never seen purple underwear before!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Maybe you were adopted.Give me a Pepsi Free.Damn! I'm late for school!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Well, I figured, what the hell?See you in about 30 years.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Whoa. This is heavy.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.He's a Peeping Tom!The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Damn! I'm late for school!Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Weight has nothing to do with it.He's a Peeping Tom!Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!He's a Peeping Tom!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Weight has nothing to do with it.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.I've never seen purple underwear before!Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact.

But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Crazy drunk driver.He's an absolute dream!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Well, I figured, what the hell?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Weight has nothing to do with it.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Yeah, well, history is gonna change.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Save the clock tower!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker.

Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.You're late!

He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Crazy drunk driver.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!He's a Peeping Tom!Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Well, I figured, what the hell?I finally invent something that works!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.

Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Great Scott!Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!He's a Peeping Tom!See you in about 30 years.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!See you in about 30 years.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.My equipment.

Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?What are you looking at, butthead?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Save the clock tower!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?He's an absolute dream!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Weight has nothing to do with it.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Marty, will we ever see you again?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Maybe you were adopted.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model.

Whoo! Time to change that oil.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Marty, will we ever see you again?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Perfect! My experiment worked!

Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Crazy drunk driver.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker.

He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?'

You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Damn!

But your kids are gonna love it.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.No!

Why do you keep calling me Calvin?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?You really think I ought to swear?Scram, McFly.

Whoo! Time to change that oil.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing.

Bring in the next group, please.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.See you in about 30 years.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch.

He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Well, I figured, what the hell?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Crazy drunk driver.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!That's Strickland.

Do we become assholes or something?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.You're late!

So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Great Scott!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Look!

Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?What are you looking at, butthead?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Marty, will we ever see you again?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Save the clock tower!Give me a Pepsi Free.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I've never seen purple underwear before!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?You really think I ought to swear?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Maybe you were adopted.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Whoa. This is heavy.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?What are you looking at, butthead?He's an absolute dream!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Damn! I'm late for school!He's an absolute dream!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.He's a Peeping Tom!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Great Scott!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Perfect! My experiment worked!

Better get used to these bars, kid.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Give me a Pepsi Free.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.I finally invent something that works!I finally invent something that works!Damn!

I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!He's a Peeping Tom!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Whoa. This is heavy.Wait a minute.

Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days.

Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.No!

Although, if it wasn't for him...Give me a Pepsi Free.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man.

Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Give me a Pepsi Free.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Oh. One other thing.

Do you have no concept of time?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Biff. What a character.

He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.I finally invent something that works!You really think I ought to swear?I've never seen purple underwear before!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Crazy drunk driver.I've never seen purple underwear before!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Well, I figured, what the hell?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?He's an absolute dream!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!See you in about 30 years.He's a Peeping Tom!See you in about 30 years.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Damn! I'm late for school!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Whoa. This is heavy.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Save the clock tower!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Weight has nothing to do with it.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler!

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Save the clock tower!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Weight has nothing to do with it.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Weight has nothing to do with it.Well, I figured, what the hell?Look, Marvin, you gotta play.

Hey, you on the bike!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.See you later, Pop.

Good night, future boy!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.What are you looking at, butthead?Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Lorraine.

On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?See you in about 30 years.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Damn! I'm late for school!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Oh. One other thing.

Help me take him in the house!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today.

On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Weight has nothing to do with it.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Great Scott!See you in about 30 years.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.I've never seen purple underwear before!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Whoa. This is heavy.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I've never seen purple underwear before!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?That's Strickland.

This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Maybe you were adopted.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Roads?

Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.He's a Peeping Tom!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!He's an absolute dream!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Wait a minute.

Do you have no concept of time?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?'

And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Oh, that's Joey.

He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row.

I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.You really think I ought to swear?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Whoa.

I mean, your destiny.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Crazy drunk driver.Weight has nothing to do with it.See you in about 30 years.Give me a Pepsi Free.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.

My density has brought me to you.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Marty, will we ever see you again?Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Whoa. This is heavy.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.

No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!You really think I ought to swear?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today.

Hey, you on the bike!Marty, will we ever see you again?I finally invent something that works!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.I've never seen purple underwear before!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit?

Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Weight has nothing to do with it.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running.

This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Whoa. This is heavy.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker.

He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see.

I could've been killed!Marty, will we ever see you again?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor?

I'm late for school!Marty, will we ever see you again?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.See you in about 30 years.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Marty, will we ever see you again?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.What are you looking at, butthead?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Who the hell is John F.

It worked!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!He's a Peeping Tom!What are you looking at, butthead?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.No wonder your president has to be an actor.

Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor.

Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Weight has nothing to do with it.Hey, McFly!

Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Save the clock tower!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!You really think I ought to swear?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Marty, will we ever see you again?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Give me a Pepsi Free.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Give me a Pepsi Free.You're late!

This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.I've never seen purple underwear before!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here!

Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.He's an absolute dream!I finally invent something that works!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Now, remember.

Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.I've never seen purple underwear before!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

Bring in the next group, please.Well, I figured, what the hell?He's an absolute dream!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Weight has nothing to do with it.Don't be so gullible, McFly.

I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.He's an absolute dream!Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Radiation suit? Of course.

Nobody has two television sets.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Look!

He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Give me a Pepsi Free.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?You really think I ought to swear?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Well, I figured, what the hell?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Course!

Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Give me a Pepsi Free.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Well, I figured, what the hell?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days.

Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!He's a Peeping Tom!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Calvin?

I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it?

I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Maybe you were adopted.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today.

This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Marty, will we ever see you again?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?I finally invent something that works!Crazy drunk driver.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!I've never seen purple underwear before!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.He's a Peeping Tom!Crazy drunk driver.Save the clock tower!Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Weight has nothing to do with it.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.I finally invent something that works!Save the clock tower!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Damn! I'm late for school!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Whoa. This is heavy.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Well, I figured, what the hell?I've never seen purple underwear before!Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Weight has nothing to do with it.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Save the clock tower!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Maybe you were adopted.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.He's a Peeping Tom!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists.

Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch.

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!What about all that talk about screwing up future events?

You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Give me a Pepsi Free.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.I've never seen purple underwear before!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Course!

We're the Pinheads.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!What are you looking at, butthead?You really think I ought to swear?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Save the clock tower!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Marty, don't be such a square.

But your kids are gonna love it.Give me a Pepsi Free.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Save the clock tower!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Don't be so gullible, McFly.

I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.What are you looking at, butthead?Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.See you in about 30 years.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Marty, will we ever see you again?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.That's Strickland.

Jerry Lewis?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Whoa. This is heavy.Well, I figured, what the hell?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?What are you looking at, butthead?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.

Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Great Scott!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Okay. Time circuit's on.

What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!See you in about 30 years.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?I've never seen purple underwear before!No!

Get your damn hands off her!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Well, I figured, what the hell?Don't be so gullible, McFly.

And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.

My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph.

Jerry Lewis?I've never seen purple underwear before!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Great Scott!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys.

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!You really think I ought to swear?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Marty, will we ever see you again?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Maybe you were adopted.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother.

My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.

Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Weight has nothing to do with it.Maybe you were adopted.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.There's that word again.

I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.No! Marty!

Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Weight has nothing to do with it.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Hey, Dad! George!

I thought I told you never to come in here.Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life.

He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Great Scott!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think!

One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Don't be so gullible, McFly.

He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president?

Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous.

Time to change that oil.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it?

George! Hey, you on the bike!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.See you in about 30 years.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Weight has nothing to do with it.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Save the clock tower!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.I finally invent something that works!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!What are you looking at, butthead?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Maybe you were adopted.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.I finally invent something that works!Crazy drunk driver.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Give me a Pepsi Free.Well, I figured, what the hell?Give me a Pepsi Free.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row.

I could've been killed!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?What are you looking at, butthead?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Scram, McFly.

Run for it, Marty!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler!

As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Oh, that's Joey.

Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Maybe you were adopted.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.What are you looking at, butthead?Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.See you in about 30 years.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Save the clock tower!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Crazy drunk driver.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Weight has nothing to do with it.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.He's a Peeping Tom!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Whoa. This is heavy.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Marty, will we ever see you again?You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.What are you looking at, butthead?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!I finally invent something that works!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Don't worry.

If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Give me a Pepsi Free.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?He's a Peeping Tom!See you in about 30 years.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Give me a Pepsi Free.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Whoa. This is heavy.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Well, I figured, what the hell?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Maybe you were adopted.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.You really think I ought to swear?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!I finally invent something that works!Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!He's a Peeping Tom!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.You really think I ought to swear?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.See you in about 30 years.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Marty, will we ever see you again?Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Well, I figured, what the hell?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Hey, come on.

On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!What are you looking at, butthead?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.I finally invent something that works!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Weight has nothing to do with it.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Course!

If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?I finally invent something that works!Don't be so gullible, McFly.

I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school.

I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.He's an absolute dream!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother.

I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Great Scott!He laid out Biff in one punch.

My density has brought me to you.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Radiation suit? Of course.

Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.I've never seen purple underwear before!Oh, that's Joey.

See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days.

I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Great Scott!Maybe you were adopted.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.I've never seen purple underwear before!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.

Where we're going, we don't need roads.He's a Peeping Tom!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!I've never seen purple underwear before!There's that word again. 'Heavy.'

Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor.

I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly?

He's gotta look good on television.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row.

I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Damn! I'm late for school!Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!What are you looking at, butthead?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Let's see if you bastards can do 90.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening.

Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man.

I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density.

I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Great Scott!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row.

It was terrible.Weight has nothing to do with it.Give me a Pepsi Free.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?See you in about 30 years.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Oh.

Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Whoa. This is heavy.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.

We're the Pinheads.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Whoa. This is heavy.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Damn! I'm late for school!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.See you in about 30 years.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?He's a Peeping Tom!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?I've never seen purple underwear before!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Look!

My density has brought me to you.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.See you in about 30 years.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot.

Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.You really think I ought to swear?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.See you in about 30 years.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.What are you looking at, butthead?Damn! I'm late for school!Weight has nothing to do with it.Save the clock tower!Give me a Pepsi Free.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Well, I figured, what the hell?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Weight has nothing to do with it.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.You really think I ought to swear?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Save the clock tower!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Great Scott!Whoa. This is heavy.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Well, I figured, what the hell?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Save the clock tower!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Perfect! My experiment worked!

Nobody has two television sets.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.I finally invent something that works!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Save the clock tower!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.See you in about 30 years.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.He's a Peeping Tom!Great Scott!Crazy drunk driver.See you in about 30 years.See you in about 30 years.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Whoa. This is heavy.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Damn! I'm late for school!Crazy drunk driver.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.See you in about 30 years.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?'

Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!What are you looking at, butthead?Whoa. This is heavy.Now, remember.

Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Calm down, Marty.

Shoot it!Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Whoa. This is heavy.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.You really think I ought to swear?And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Well, I figured, what the hell?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Save the clock tower!The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.See you in about 30 years.Whoa. This is heavy.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.He's a Peeping Tom!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.He's an absolute dream!He's a Peeping Tom!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah...

Hey, you on the bike!Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Damn! I'm late for school!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!See you in about 30 years.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

It was terrible.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Scram, McFly.

Jerry Lewis?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.

Get your damn hands off her!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.What are you looking at, butthead?He's an absolute dream!Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Give me a Pepsi Free.He's a Peeping Tom!I've never seen purple underwear before!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too.

So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.What are you looking at, butthead?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?What are you looking at, butthead?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Weight has nothing to do with it.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Well, I figured, what the hell?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Maybe you were adopted.What are you looking at, butthead?I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Maybe you were adopted.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.

You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Weight has nothing to do with it.Well, I figured, what the hell?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Save the clock tower!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Whoa. This is heavy.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.No!

Get your damn hands off her!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Give me a Pepsi Free.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Damn! I'm late for school!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me.

Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president?

Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Well, I figured, what the hell?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?This is all wrong.

You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!What are you looking at, butthead?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Maybe you were adopted.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I've never seen purple underwear before!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Damn! I'm late for school!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Damn! I'm late for school!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?I finally invent something that works!Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Damn! I'm late for school!Damn! I'm late for school!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Maybe you were adopted.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.You really think I ought to swear?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Damn! I'm late for school!No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!I've never seen purple underwear before!Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?You really think I ought to swear?The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?'

They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Whoa. This is heavy.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Well, I figured, what the hell?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model.

The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?See you in about 30 years.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Marty, don't be such a square.

Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Weight has nothing to do with it.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.

Do we become assholes or something?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Marty, will we ever see you again?See you in about 30 years.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Course!

Jerry Lewis?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?What are you looking at, butthead?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row.

Bring in the next group, please.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Damn! I'm late for school!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Marty, will we ever see you again?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Maybe you were adopted.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Damn! I'm late for school!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.He's a Peeping Tom!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Maybe you were adopted.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.He's a Peeping Tom!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Marty, will we ever see you again?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.See you later, Pop.

Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Great Scott!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.I finally invent something that works!Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Marty, will we ever see you again?Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.He's an absolute dream!Don't worry.

Hey, you on the bike!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?What are you looking at, butthead?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Crazy drunk driver.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Well, I figured, what the hell?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?I finally invent something that works!You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker.

Do I know your mother?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.He's a Peeping Tom!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Whoa. This is heavy.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Silence, Earthling.

It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.See you in about 30 years.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Great Scott!Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Maybe you were adopted.Whoa. This is heavy.Marty, will we ever see you again?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Well, I figured, what the hell?This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Save the clock tower!He's an absolute dream!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.What are you looking at, butthead?Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Weight has nothing to do with it.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?I've never seen purple underwear before!Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Give me a Pepsi Free.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.He's an absolute dream!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Well, I figured, what the hell?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?See you in about 30 years.He's an absolute dream!He's a Peeping Tom!Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Save the clock tower!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Maybe you were adopted.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Maybe you were adopted.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!He's an absolute dream!Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Marty, will we ever see you again?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Crazy drunk driver.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!He's a Peeping Tom!Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man.

As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Maybe you were adopted.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too.

I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?See you in about 30 years.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Crazy drunk driver.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.Give me a Pepsi Free.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Well, I figured, what the hell?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.

If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!He laid out Biff in one punch.

Everybody who's anybody drinks.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.What about all that talk about screwing up future events?

I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.See you in about 30 years.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Weight has nothing to do with it.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Well, I figured, what the hell?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Weight has nothing to do with it.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Weight has nothing to do with it.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Whoa. This is heavy.Give me a Pepsi Free.Let's see if you bastards can do 90.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Maybe you were adopted.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.He's an absolute dream!Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Marty, will we ever see you again?Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys.

My density has brought me to you.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Yeah, well, history is gonna change.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.You really think I ought to swear?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya?

I mean, your destiny.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.You're late! Do you have no concept of time?He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.See you in about 30 years.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.We're the, uh...

Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?I finally invent something that works!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me.

One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.We're the, uh...

Good night, future boy!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!What are you looking at, butthead?I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?You really think I ought to swear?I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!I've never seen purple underwear before!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Yeah, well, history is gonna change.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?See you in about 30 years.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!You're late! Do you have no concept of time?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?Maybe you were adopted.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Crazy drunk driver.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!What are you looking at, butthead?Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Give me a Pepsi Free.Damn! I'm late for school!You really think I ought to swear?Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.He's an absolute dream!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Marty, will we ever see you again?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.No!

Where we're going, we don't need roads.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Save the clock tower!Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.Look, Marvin, you gotta play.

My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.

See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.I finally invent something that works!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.That's Strickland.

Your friend, Marty.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.Roads?

The old man really came through. It worked!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Let's see if you bastards can do 90.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!Crazy drunk driver.Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Damn! I'm late for school!Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please.

I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

Where we're going, we don't need roads.And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.He's an absolute dream!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Oh, that's Joey.

Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!Crazy drunk driver.This is all wrong. I don't know what it is.

I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.Damn! I'm late for school!You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Well, I figured, what the hell?He's a Peeping Tom!That's Strickland.

If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?He's a Peeping Tom!Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped.

Better get used to these bars, kid.Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Hello?

I'm late for school!I finally invent something that works!I've never seen purple underwear before!Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Save the clock tower!Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Marty, will we ever see you again?You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.I finally invent something that works!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance.

My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Maybe you were adopted.Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?See you in about 30 years.Well, I figured, what the hell?That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?What-what the hell is a gigawatt?Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?You're late! Do you have no concept of time?So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Marty, will we ever see you again?Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think!

Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.Maybe you were adopted.The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!He's an absolute dream!I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier.

They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Marty, will we ever see you again?He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density.

Good night, future boy!I've never seen purple underwear before!You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.Well, I figured, what the hell?Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Marty, will we ever see you again?Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah...

You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance.

He's gotta look good on television.Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly?

He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.He's a Peeping Tom!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.Save the clock tower!I've never seen purple underwear before!Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

I thought I told you never to come in here.I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.

They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!Great Scott!Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good?

My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?All right.

Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model.

You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!Weight has nothing to do with it.I've never seen purple underwear before!I had a horrible nightmare.

This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?No! Marty!
